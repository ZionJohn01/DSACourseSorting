# DSACourseSorting
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this project, the aim was to create a way to easily sort and search for courses at our school. We created a menu to allow for multiple options for the user. I selected vectors as my data structure which allowed me to effectively sort through the many courses available and more efficiently search through them.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Like I stated before, I used the vector data structure to approach the problem. I could have used the hash table data structure to decrease time complexity but I wanted to challenge what I thought would be the easier option.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I felt a little stuck at some point while writing the code. I was able to go back into our 'textbook' (zybooks) and find a good example to draw inspiration from.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I'm not always the most comfortable while writing C++ but this was a really good experience. I think in the future I will be writing more code in C++. The course has also helped a lot of my understanding in how to actually design code. The pseudocode sections helped my understanding a lot.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The pseudocode sections I feel really improved my understanding of how to write programs. I haven't found myself writing pseudocode for the smaller projects that I do on the side but I think I'm going to give it a try and see how it works out for me.
